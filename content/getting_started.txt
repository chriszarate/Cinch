# Getting Started

### Setup

1. Grant PHP write access to the "cache" directory.

2. Review ".htaccess". It may be necessary to make changes.


### Template

The file "index.html" is not a template. It is your home page. There is only one template: "page.html".


### Pages

Create a new page by creating a file in the "content" directory.

* `.txt` files will be formatted by [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and [Smartypants](http://daringfireball.net/projects/smartypants/)
* `.html` files will be unaltered
* `.php` files will be included as PHP code

Use the basename of the file (e.g., "[tips\_and\_tricks](tips_and_tricks)") to access your page.
